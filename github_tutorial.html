        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Tanzim Hasan. I graduated from the Baccalaureate School of Global Education. Obviously, I am a first year software engineer at RIT. When it comes to hobbies, I do like to sleep and eat a lot. I play a lot of VALORANT and League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. As of right now that's really all I do. I was born and raised in NYC Queens. My favorite food to eat is just regular chicken and rice.</p>
